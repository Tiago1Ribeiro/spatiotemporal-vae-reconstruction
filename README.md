## Modelling forest fire dynamics using conditional variational auto-encoders (Under Review)

## TL;DR

This research applies deep networks to simulate the spatial and temporal evolution of a forest fire's impact on a region. Using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) model, we generate intermediate representations of the burnt area's evolution. we also employ a CVAE model to predict future fire propagation behavior, estimating the burnt area at various time horizons and propagation stages. Real-world data is used to assess the model's performance, with results showing high similarity and temporal consistency metrics, indicating that the application of CVAE in this context is capable.
